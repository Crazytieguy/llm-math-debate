Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (45,-216)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (45,-216)=\gcd (45,216)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 45 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,3,5,9,15,45$

3. The divisors of 216 are:

$1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,27,36,54,72,108,216$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }9: \\
\text{ divisors of 45: }1,3,5,9,15,45 \\
\text{ divisors of 216: }1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,27,36,54,72,108,216 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (45,-216)=9$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
