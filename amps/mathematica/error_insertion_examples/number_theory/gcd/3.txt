Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (401,153)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 401 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,401$

2. The divisors of 153 are:

$1,3,9,17,51,153$

3. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 401: }1,401 \\
\text{ divisors of 153: }1,3,9,17,51,153 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (401,153)=1$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
