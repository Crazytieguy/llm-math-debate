Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (271,336)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 271 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,271$

2. The divisors of 336 are:

$1,2,3,4,6,7,8,12,14,16,21,24,28,42,48,56,84,112,168,336$

3. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 271: }1,271 \\
\text{ divisors of 336: }1,2,3,4,6,7,8,12,14,16,21,24,28,42,48,56,84,112,168,336 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (271,336)=1$

```

Insert an error into step 3.
