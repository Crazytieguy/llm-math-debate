Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (16,417)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 16 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,2,4,8,16$

2. The divisors of 417 are:

$1,3,139,417$

3. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 16: }1,2,4,8,16 \\
\text{ divisors of 417: }1,3,139,417 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (16,417)=1$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
