Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (326,928,825)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 326 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,2,163,326$

2. The divisors of 928 are:

$1,2,4,8,16,29,32,58,116,232,464,928$

3. The divisors of 825 are:

$1,3,5,11,15,25,33,55,75,165,275,825$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to all divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 326: }1,2,163,326 \\
\text{ divisors of 928: }1,2,4,8,16,29,32,58,116,232,464,928 \\
\text{ divisors of 825: }1,3,5,11,15,25,33,55,75,165,275,825 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (326,928,825)=1$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
