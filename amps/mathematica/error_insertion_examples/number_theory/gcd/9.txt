Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (5,272,-137)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (5,272,-137)=\gcd (5,272,137)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of }5\text{ are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,5$

3. The divisors of 272 are:

$1,2,4,8,16,17,34,68,136,272$

4. The divisors of 137 are:

$1,137$

5. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to all divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of }5: 1,5 \\
\text{ divisors of 272: }1,2,4,8,16,17,34,68,136,272 \\
\text{ divisors of 137: }1,137 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (5,272,-137)=1$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
