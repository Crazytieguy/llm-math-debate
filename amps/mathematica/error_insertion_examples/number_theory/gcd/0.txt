Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (462,-456)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (462,-456)=\gcd (462,456)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 462 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,2,3,6,7,11,14,21,22,33,42,66,77,154,231,462$

3. The divisors of 456 are:

$1,2,3,4,6,8,12,19,24,38,57,76,114,152,228,456$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }6: \\
\text{ divisors of 462: }1,2,3,6,7,11,14,21,22,33,42,66,77,154,231,462 \\
\text{ divisors of 456: }1,2,3,4,6,8,12,19,24,38,57,76,114,152,228,456 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (462,-456)=6$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
