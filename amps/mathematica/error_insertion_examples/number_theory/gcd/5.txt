Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (-244,-467,-270)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (-244,-467,-270)=\gcd (244,467,270)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 244 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,2,4,61,122,244$

3. The divisors of 467 are:

$1,467$

4. The divisors of 270 are:

$1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,27,30,45,54,90,135,270$

5. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to all divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 244: }1,2,4,61,122,244 \\
\text{ divisors of 467: }1,467 \\
\text{ divisors of 270: }1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,27,30,45,54,90,135,270 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (-244,-467,-270)=1$

```
