Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (-30,501,-13)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (-30,501,-13)=\gcd (30,501,13)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 30 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30$

3. The divisors of 501 are:

$1,3,167,501$

4. The divisors of 13 are:

$1,13$

5. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to all divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 30: }1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30 \\
\text{ divisors of 501: }1,3,167,501 \\
\text{ divisors of 13: }1,13 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (-30,501,-13)=1$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
