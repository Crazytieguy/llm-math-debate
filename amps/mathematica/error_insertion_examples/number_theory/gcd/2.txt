Given the following problem:

```

Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (475,-944)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (475,-944)=\gcd (475,944)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 475 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,5,19,25,95,475$

3. The divisors of 944 are:

$1,2,4,8,16,59,118,236,472,944$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 475: }1,5,19,25,95,475 \\
\text{ divisors of 944: }1,2,4,8,16,59,118,236,472,944 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (475,-944)=1$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
