Explanation: The absolute value of $-216$ is $216$, not $215$.

Note: Make sure to carry the error onto subsequent steps, replacing $216$ with $215$, and the original list of divisors with $1,5,43,215$.

Modified solution:

```

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (45,-216)=\gcd (45,215)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 45 are}:                                                              \\
\end{array}$

$1,3,5,9,15,45$

3. The divisors of 215 are:

$1,5,43,215$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }5: \\
\text{ divisors of 45: }1,3,5,9,15,45                        \\
\text{ divisors of 216: }1,5,43,215                          \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (45,-216)=5$
