Given the following problem:

```

Determine if the following numbers are coprime to each other:

$284\text{ and }725$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. By definition, these numbers are coprime if their gcd is $1:$

$\gcd (284,725)=1$

2. Since these numbers have a gcd equal to $1,$ they are coprime:

Answer: 284 and $725$ are coprime

```

Insert an error into step 1.
