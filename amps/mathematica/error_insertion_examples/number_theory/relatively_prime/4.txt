Given the following problem:

```

Determine if the following numbers are coprime to each other:

$-397\text{ and }-196$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. By definition, these numbers are coprime if their gcd is $1:$

$\gcd (-397,-196)=1$

2. Since these numbers have a gcd equal to $1,$ they are coprime:

Answer: $-397\text{ and }-196$ are coprime

```

Insert an error into step 1.
