Given the following problem:

```

Determine if the following numbers are coprime to each other:

$-675\text{ and }-846$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. By definition, these numbers are coprime if their gcd is $1:$

$\gcd (-675,-846)=9$

2. Since these numbers have a gcd greater than $1,$ they are not coprime:

Answer: $-675\text{ and }-846$ are not coprime

```

Insert an error into step 1.
