Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(7,61)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of }7\text{ is}: \\
\end{array}$

$7=7^1$

2. The prime factorization of 61 is:

$61=61^1$

3. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }7\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }7^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 61 that appears in the prime factorizations is }61^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(7,61)=\left(7^1\times 61^1=427\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(7,61)=427$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
