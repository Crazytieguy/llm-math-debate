Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-87,-40,-58)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-87,-40,-58)=\text{lcm}(87,40,58)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 87 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$87=3\times 29$

3. The prime factorization of 40 is:

$40=2^3\times 5$

4. The prime factorization of 58 is:

$58=2\times 29$

5. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }2\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }2^3 \\
\text{ The largest power of }3\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }3^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of }5\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }5^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 29 that appears in the prime factorizations is }29^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(87,40,58)=\left(2^3\times 3^1\times 5^1\times 29^1=3480\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-87,-40,-58)=3480$
