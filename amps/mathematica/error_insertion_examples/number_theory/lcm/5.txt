Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-57,-67)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-57,-67)=\text{lcm}(57,67)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 57 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$57=3\times 19$

3. The prime factorization of 67 is:

$67=67^1$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }3\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }3^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 19 that appears in the prime factorizations is }19^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 67 that appears in the prime factorizations is }67^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(57,67)=\left(3^1\times 19^1\times 67^1=3819\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-57,-67)=3819$
