Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(54,-44)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(54,-44)=\text{lcm}(54,44)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 54 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$54=2\times 3^3$

3. The prime factorization of 44 is:

$44=2^2\times 11$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }2\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }2^2 \\
\text{ The largest power of }3\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }3^3 \\
\text{ The largest power of 11 that appears in the prime factorizations is }11^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(54,44)=\left(2^2\times 3^3\times 11^1=1188\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(54,-44)=1188$
