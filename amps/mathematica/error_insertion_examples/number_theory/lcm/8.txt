Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-87,66)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-87,66)=\text{lcm}(87,66)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 87 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$87=3\times 29$

3. The prime factorization of 66 is:

$66=2\times 3\times 11$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }2\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }2^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of }3\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }3^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 11 that appears in the prime factorizations is }11^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 29 that appears in the prime factorizations is }29^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(87,66)=\left(2^1\times 3^1\times 11^1\times 29^1=1914\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-87,66)=1914$

```

Insert an error into step 4.
