Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-17,29,55)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-17,29,55)=\text{lcm}(17,29,55)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 17 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$17=17^1$

3. The prime factorization of 29 is:

$29=29^1$

4. The prime factorization of 55 is:

$55=5\times 11$

5. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }5\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }5^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 11 that appears in the prime factorizations is }11^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 17 that appears in the prime factorizations is }17^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 29 that appears in the prime factorizations is }29^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(17,29,55)=\left(5^1\times 11^1\times 17^1\times 29^1=27115\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-17,29,55)=27115$

```

Insert an error into step 5.
