Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-86,-32,-37)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-86,-32,-37)=\text{lcm}(86,32,37)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 86 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$86=2\times 43$

3. The prime factorization of 32 is:

$32=2^5$

4. The prime factorization of 37 is:

$37=37^1$

5. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }2\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }2^5 \\
\text{ The largest power of 37 that appears in the prime factorizations is }37^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 43 that appears in the prime factorizations is }43^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(86,32,37)=\left(2^5\times 37^1\times 43^1=50912\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-86,-32,-37)=50912$
