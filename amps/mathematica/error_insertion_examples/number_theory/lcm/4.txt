Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-85,-76)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-85,-76)=\text{lcm}(85,76)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 85 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$85=5\times 17$

3. The prime factorization of 76 is:

$76=2^2\times 19$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }2\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }2^2 \\
\text{ The largest power of }5\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }5^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 17 that appears in the prime factorizations is }17^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 19 that appears in the prime factorizations is }19^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(85,76)=\left(2^2\times 5^1\times 17^1\times 19^1=6460\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-85,-76)=6460$
