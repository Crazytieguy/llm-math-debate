Given the following problem:

```

Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(63,6)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 63 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$63=3^2\times 7$

2. The prime factorization of $6$ is:

$6=2\times 3$

3. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }2\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }2^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of }3\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }3^2 \\
\text{ The largest power of }7\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }7^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(63,6)=\left(2^1\times 3^2\times 7^1=126\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(63,6)=126$

```

Insert an error into step 3.
