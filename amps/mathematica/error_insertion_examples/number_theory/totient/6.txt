Given the following problem:

```

Compute the Euler phi function for $4049:$

$\phi (4049)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Apply the the Euler phi function definition to $4049:$

$\phi (4049)\text{ is the number of elements of }\{1,2,\ldots ,4049\}\text{ that are coprime to }4049$

2. 4049 is prime Since the divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself, all positive integers less than 4049 are coprime to $4049:$

Answer: $\phi (4049)=4048$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
