Given the following problem:

```

Compute the Euler phi function for $649:$

$\phi (649)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Apply the the Euler phi function definition to $649:$

$\phi (649)\text{ is the number of elements of }\{1,2,\ldots ,649\}\text{ that are coprime to }649$

2. For a positive integer $n, \phi (n)=n \left(\prod _{\text{p $|$ n}} \left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\right),\text{ where the product is over the distinct prime numbers that divide }n:$

$\phi (649)=649 \prod _{\text{p $|$ 649}} \left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)$

3. The prime factorization of 649 is $11\times 59,$ so the prime factors of 649 are:

11 and $59$

4. Substituting the prime factors into the Euler product formula gives:

Answer: $\phi (649)=\left(649 \left(1-\frac{1}{11}\right) \left(1-\frac{1}{59}\right)=580\right)$

```

Insert an error into step 4.
