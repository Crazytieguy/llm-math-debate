Given the following problem:

```

Compute the Euler phi function for $3407:$

$\phi (3407)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. Apply the the Euler phi function definition to $3407:$

$\phi (3407)\text{ is the number of elements of }\{1,2,\ldots ,3407\}\text{ that are coprime to }3407$

2. 3407 is prime Since the divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself, all positive integers less than 3407 are coprime to $3407:$

Answer: $\phi (3407)=3406$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
