Explanation: $\sqrt{42}$ is not $\sqrt{3^2\times 7}$ but $\sqrt{2\times 3\times 7}$, which can't be simplified.

Note: Make sure to carry the error onto subsequent steps, replacing $\sqrt{42}$ with $3 \sqrt{7}$.

Modified solution:

```

1. $\sqrt{42} = \sqrt{3^2\times 7} = 3 \sqrt{7}:$

Answer: $\sqrt{193}-\sqrt{36}+3 \sqrt{7}$

```
