Explanation: The negative sign of elements in the list was ignored.

Note: Make sure to carry the error onto subsequent steps, replacing $-4 e-2 e+e-e-2 e-3 e-2 e+e$ with $4 e+2 e+e+e+2 e+3 e+2 e+e$ and $-12 e$ with $16 e$.

```

1. The mean of a list of numbers is given by:

$\frac{(\text{sum of elements})}{(\text{number of elements})}$

2. $(\text{sum of elements}) = 4 e+2 e+e+e+2 e+3 e+2 e+e:$

$\frac{4 e+2 e+e+e+2 e+3 e+2 e+e}{(\text{number of elements})}$

3. Counting, we see that the list has $8$ elements:

$\frac{4 e+2 e+e+e+2 e+3 e+2 e+e}{8}$

4. $4 e+2 e+e+e+2 e+3 e+2 e+e = 16 e:$

$\frac{1}{8} (16 e)$

5. $\frac{16 e}{8}=2 e$:

Answer: $2 e$
