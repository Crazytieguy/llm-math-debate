Explanation: The list has $6$ elements, not $5$ elements.

Note: Make sure to carry the error onto subsequent steps, replacing $6$ with $5$.

```

1. The mean of a list of numbers is given by:

$\frac{(\text{sum of elements})}{(\text{number of elements})}$

2. $(\text{sum of elements}) = -9-4+7-2-9+7:$

$\frac{-9-4+7-2-9+7}{(\text{number of elements})}$

3. Counting, we see that the list has $5$ elements:

$\frac{-9-4+7-2-9+7}{5}$

4. $-9-4+7-2-9+7 = -10:$

$\frac{-10}{5}$

5. $\frac{-10}{5}=-2$:

Answer: $-2$
