Explanation: The second to last element in the list, $3 e$, was dropped.

Note: Make sure to carry the error onto subsequent steps, replacing $-3 e+3 e-3 e+e+0-2 e+3 e-4 e$ with $-3 e+3 e-3 e+e+0-2 e-4 e$ and $-5 e$ with $-8 e$.

```

1. The mean of a list of numbers is given by:

$\frac{(\text{sum of elements})}{(\text{number of elements})}$

2. $(\text{sum of elements}) = -3 e+3 e-3 e+e+0-2 e-4 e:$

$\frac{-3 e+3 e-3 e+e+0-2 e-4 e}{(\text{number of elements})}$

3. Counting, we see that the list has $8$ elements:

$\frac{-3 e+3 e-3 e+e+0-2 e-4 e}{8}$

4. $-3 e+3 e-3 e+e+0-2 e-4 e = -8 e:$

$\frac{-8 e}{8}$

5. $\frac{-8 e}{8} = -e$:

Answer: $-e$
