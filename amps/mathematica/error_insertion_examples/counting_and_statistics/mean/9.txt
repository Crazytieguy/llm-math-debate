Given the following problem:

```

Find the mean of the list:

$(-1,0,-2,3,-10,-2)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The mean of a list of numbers is given by:

$\frac{(\text{sum of elements})}{(\text{number of elements})}$

2. $(\text{sum of elements}) = -1+0-2+3-10-2:$

$\frac{-1+0-2+3-10-2}{(\text{number of elements})}$

3. Counting, we see that the list has $6$ elements:

$\frac{-1+0-2+3-10-2}{6}$

4. $-1+0-2+3-10-2 = -12:$

$\frac{-12}{6}$

5. $\frac{-12}{6}=-2:$

Answer: $-2$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
