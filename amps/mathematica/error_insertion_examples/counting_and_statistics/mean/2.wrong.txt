Explanation: This computes the median, not the mean.

Note: Make sure to follow through and compute the median instead of the mean, but use the word mean.

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$\left(-6 \sqrt{2},-4 \sqrt{2},-2 \sqrt{2}\right)$

2. The mean of the list $\left(-6 \sqrt{2},-4 \sqrt{2},-2 \sqrt{2}\right)$ is the element in the middle, which is:

Answer: $-4 \sqrt{2}$

```
