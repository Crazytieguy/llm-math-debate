Given the following problem:

```

Find the mean of the list:

$(-8,9,2,8,1)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The mean of a list of numbers is given by:

$\frac{(\text{sum of elements})}{(\text{number of elements})}$

2. $(\text{sum of elements}) = -8+9+2+8+1:$

$\frac{-8+9+2+8+1}{(\text{number of elements})}$

3. Counting, we see that the list has $5$ elements:

$\frac{-8+9+2+8+1}{5}$

4. $-8+9+2+8+1 = 12:$

Answer: $\frac{12}{5}\approx 2.4$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
