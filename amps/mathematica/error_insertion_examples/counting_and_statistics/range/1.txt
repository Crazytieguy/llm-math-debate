Given the following problem:

```

Find the range of the list:

$\left(\frac{19}{16},\frac{35}{32},-\frac{6}{5},-7,-\frac{18}{7},-\frac{13}{4},-\frac{62}{7},-9,8,-\frac{13}{5}\right) = \left(\frac{19}{16},\frac{35}{32},-\frac{6}{5},-7,-\frac{18}{7},-\frac{13}{4},-\frac{62}{7},-9,8,-\frac{13}{5}\right)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The range of a list is given by:

$(\text{largest element})-(\text{smallest element})$

2. $\left(\frac{19}{16},\frac{35}{32},-\frac{6}{5},-7,-\frac{18}{7},-\frac{13}{4},-\frac{62}{7},-9,8,-\frac{13}{5}\right)\text{  We see that the largest element is }8:$

$8-(\text{smallest element})$

3. $\left(\frac{19}{16},\frac{35}{32},-\frac{6}{5},-7,-\frac{18}{7},-\frac{13}{4},-\frac{62}{7},-9,8,-\frac{13}{5}\right)\text{  We see that the smallest element is }-9:$

$-(-9)+8$

4. $-(-9)+8=17:$

Answer: $17$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
