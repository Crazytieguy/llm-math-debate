Given the following problem:

```

Find the median of the list:

$\left(8,-3 \sqrt{5},-3 e,0,3,-6\right)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$\left(-3 e,-3 \sqrt{5},-6,0,3,8\right)$

2. The two elements in the middle of the list $\left(-3 e,-3 \sqrt{5},-6,0,3,8\right)\text{ are }-6\text{ and }0:$

$\left(-3 e,-3 \sqrt{5},-6,0,3,8\right)$

3. The median is the average of the two middle elements, $-6\text{ and }0.$ This average is:

Answer: $\frac{0-6}{2} = -3$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
