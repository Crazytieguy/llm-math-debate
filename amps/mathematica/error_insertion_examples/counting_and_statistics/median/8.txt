Given the following problem:

```

Find the median of the list:

$\left(0,-\frac{5}{\pi },9,4,4 \sqrt{2},8,-6\right)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$\left(-6,-\frac{5}{\pi },0,4,4 \sqrt{2},8,9\right)$

2. The median of the list $\left(-6,-\frac{5}{\pi },0,4,4 \sqrt{2},8,9\right)$ is the element in the middle, which is:

Answer: $4$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
