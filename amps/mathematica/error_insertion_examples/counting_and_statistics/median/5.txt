Given the following problem:

```

Find the median of the list:

$\left(3,9,8,\frac{7}{5},\frac{9}{\sqrt{\pi }},-\frac{16}{7},-3 \sqrt{2},4 \sqrt{5},8,-6,-10\right) = \left(3,9,8,\frac{7}{5},9 \pi ^{-1/2},-\frac{16}{7},-3 \sqrt{2},4 \sqrt{5},8,-6,-10\right)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$\left(-10,-6,-3 \sqrt{2},-\frac{16}{7},\frac{7}{5},3,9 \pi ^{-1/2},8,8,4 \sqrt{5},9\right)$

2. The median of the list $\left(-10,-6,-3 \sqrt{2},-\frac{16}{7},\frac{7}{5},3,9 \pi ^{-1/2},8,8,4 \sqrt{5},9\right)$ is the element in the middle, which is:

Answer: $3$
