Explanation: The average of $-6$ and $-8 \log (2)$ is $\frac{-8 \log (2)-6}{2}$, not $\frac{-7 \log (2)}{2}$.

Note: Make sure to copy everything up to the final answer correctly.

Modified solution:

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$(-9,-8,-6,-8 \log (2),0,3)$

2. The two elements in the middle of the list $(-9,-8,-6,-8 \log (2),0,3)\text{ are }-6\text{ and }-8 \log (2):$

$(-9,-8,-6,-8 \log (2),0,3)$

3. The median is the average of the two middle elements, $-6\text{ and }-8 \log (2).$ This average is:

Answer: $\frac{-7 \log (2)}{2}$
