Given the following problem:

```

Find the median of the list:

$\left(-6,-\frac{29}{\pi },0,7,e,-3 e,0,-3 \sqrt{3},12 \log (2),3 e,-\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}},2\right)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$\left(-\frac{29}{\pi },-3 e,-6,-3 \sqrt{3},-2\ 3^{-1/2},0,0,2,e,7,3 e,12 \log (2)\right)$

2. The two elements in the middle of the list $\left(-\frac{29}{\pi },-3 e,-6,-3 \sqrt{3},-\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}},0,0,2,e,7,3 e,12 \log (2)\right)\text{ are both equal to }0:$

$\left(-\frac{29}{\pi },-3 e,-6,-3 \sqrt{3},-2\ 3^{-1/2},0,0,2,e,7,3 e,12 \log (2)\right)$

3. Since the two elements in the middle are both equal to $0,$ their average (and thus the median) is:

Answer: $0$

```

Insert an error into step 2.
