Explanation: While sorting the list, the elements $-2 \log (2)$ and $\frac{9}{e}$ were dropped. The element in the middle should be $\frac{9}{e}$, not $5$.

Note: Make sure to carry the error onto subsequent steps, dropping $-2 \log (2)$ and $\frac{9}{e}$ from the list and replacing $\frac{9}{e}$ with $5$.

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$\left(-\frac{60}{7},-2 \sqrt{5},-2 \sqrt{5},-\frac{11}{3},-\sqrt{5},5,5,6,2 \pi ,\frac{22}{\pi },13\ 2^{-1/2}\right)$

2. The median of the list $\left(-\frac{60}{7},-2 \sqrt{5},-2 \sqrt{5},-\frac{11}{3},-\sqrt{5},5,5,6,2 \pi ,\frac{22}{\pi },13\ 2^{-1/2}\right)$ is the element in the middle, which is:

Answer: $5$
