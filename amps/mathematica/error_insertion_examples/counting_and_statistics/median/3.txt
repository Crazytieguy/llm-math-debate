Given the following problem:

```

Find the median of the list:

$(-9,-8,-6,3,-8 \log (2),0)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$(-9,-8,-6,-8 \log (2),0,3)$

2. The two elements in the middle of the list $(-9,-8,-6,-8 \log (2),0,3)\text{ are }-6\text{ and }-8 \log (2):$

$(-9,-8,-6,-8 \log (2),0,3)$

3. The median is the average of the two middle elements, $-6\text{ and }-8 \log (2).$ This average is:

Answer: $\frac{-8 \log (2)-6}{2}$

```

Insert an error into step 3.
