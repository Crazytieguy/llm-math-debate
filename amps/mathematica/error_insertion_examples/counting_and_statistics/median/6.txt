Given the following problem:

```

Find the median of the list:

$\left(-2 \sqrt{5},5\right)$

```

And correct solution:

```

1. The median of $\left(-2 \sqrt{5},5\right)\text{ is the average of its two elements, }-2 \sqrt{5}\text{ and }5.$ This average is:

Answer: $\frac{5-2 \sqrt{5}}{2}=\frac{1}{2} \left(5-2 \sqrt{5}\right)$

```

Insert an error into step 1.
