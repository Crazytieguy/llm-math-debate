Explanation: There are three $-1$s in the original list, and one of them was dropped.

Note: Make sure to carry the error onto subsequent steps, replacing $\left(-\frac{29}{3},-7,-7,-7 2^{-1/2},-1,-1,-1,0,1,4,2 e\right)$ with $\left(-\frac{29}{3},-7,-7,-7 2^{-1/2},-1,-1,0,1,4,2 e\right)$ and computing the average of the two middle numbers instead of taking the middle number.

Modified solution:

```

1. The list, sorted from smallest to largest, is:

$\left(-\frac{29}{3},-7,-7,-7 2^{-1/2},-1,-1,0,1,4,2 e\right)$

2. The two elements in the middle of the list $\left(-\frac{29}{3},-7,-7,-7 2^{-1/2},-1,-1,0,1,4,2 e\right)\text{ are }-7 2^{-1/2}\text{ and }-1:$

$\left(-\frac{29}{3},-7,-7,-7 2^{-1/2},-1,-1,0,1,4,2 e\right)$

3. The median is the average of the two middle elements, $-7 2^{-1/2}\text{ and }-1.$ This average is:

Answer: $\frac{-1-7 2^{-1/2}}{2}$
