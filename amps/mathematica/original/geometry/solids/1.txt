Problem:
A polyhedron has vertices with the coordinates $\left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
 0.459 & 0.321 & 0.521 \\
 0.561 & 0.493 & 0.835 \\
 0.451 & 0.77 & 0.381 \\
 0.907 & 0.548 & 0.607 \\
 0.217 & 0.977 & 0.414 \\
\end{array}
\right)$. Estimate the polyhedron's surface area, volume, and the solid angle at the first listed point p spanned by edges with common point p.
Answer:
Surface Area: $0.58$ 
Volume: $0.02$ 
Solid Angle: $0.97$
