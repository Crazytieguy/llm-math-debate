Find the rank of the matrix:

$M=\left(
\begin{array}{c}
-5 \\
\end{array}
\right)$

\hrule

1. As each row of matrix $M$ has only zeroes to the left of the main diagonal, it is in row echelon form:

$\left(
\begin{array}{c}
-5 \\
\end{array}
\right)$

2. There is $1\text{ nonzero row in the row echelon matrix, so the rank is }1:$

Answer: rank$\left(
\begin{array}{c}
-5 \\
\end{array}
\right)=1$
