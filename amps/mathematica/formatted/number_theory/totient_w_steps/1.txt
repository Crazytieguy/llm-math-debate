Compute the Euler phi function for $2:$

$\phi (2)$

\hrule

1. Apply the the Euler phi function definition to $2:$

$\phi (2)\text{ is the number of elements of }\{1,2\}\text{ that are coprime to }2$

2. $2\text{ is prime Since the divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself, all positive integers less than }2\text{ are coprime to }2:$

Answer: $\phi (2)=1$
