Compute the Euler phi function for $5000:$

$\phi (5000)$

\hrule

1. Apply the the Euler phi function definition to $5000:$

$\phi (5000)\text{ is the number of elements of }\{1,2,\ldots ,5000\}\text{ that are coprime to }5000$

2. For a positive integer $n, \phi (n)=n \left(\prod _{\text{p $|$ n}} \left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\right),\text{ where the product is over the distinct prime numbers that divide }n:$

$\phi (5000)=5000 \prod _{\text{p $|$ 5000}} \left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)$

3. The prime factorization of 5000 is $2^3\times 5^4,$ so the prime factors of 5000 are:

$2\text{ and }5$

4. Substituting the prime factors into the Euler product formula gives:

Answer: $\phi (5000)=\left(5000 \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1-\frac{1}{5}\right)=2000\right)$
