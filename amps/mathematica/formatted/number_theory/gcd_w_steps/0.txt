Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (-783,-198)$

\hrule

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (-783,-198)=\gcd (783,198)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 783 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,3,9,27,29,87,261,783$

3. The divisors of 198 are:

$1,2,3,6,9,11,18,22,33,66,99,198$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to both divisor lists is }9: \\
\text{ divisors of 783: }1,3,9,27,29,87,261,783 \\
\text{ divisors of 198: }1,2,3,6,9,11,18,22,33,66,99,198 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (-783,-198)=9$
