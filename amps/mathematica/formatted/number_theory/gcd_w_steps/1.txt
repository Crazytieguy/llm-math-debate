Find the greatest common divisor:

$\gcd (241,-440,276)$

\hrule

1. Any divisor of a negative number is also a divisor of its absolute value:

$\gcd (241,-440,276)=\gcd (241,440,276)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the divisors of each integer and select the largest element they have in common}: \\
\text{ The divisors of 241 are}: \\
\end{array}$

$1,241$

3. The divisors of 440 are:

$1,2,4,5,8,10,11,20,22,40,44,55,88,110,220,440$

4. The divisors of 276 are:

$1,2,3,4,6,12,23,46,69,92,138,276$

5. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{The largest number common to all divisor lists is }1: \\
\text{ divisors of 241: }1,241 \\
\text{ divisors of 440: }1,2,4,5,8,10,11,20,22,40,44,55,88,110,220,440 \\
\text{ divisors of 276: }1,2,3,4,6,12,23,46,69,92,138,276 \\
\end{array}$

Answer: $\gcd (241,-440,276)=1$
