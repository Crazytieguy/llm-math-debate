Factor the following integer:

$3$

\hrule

1. $3\text{ is not divisible by }2\text{ since }3\text{ is odd and }2$ is even:

$3=3(3\text{ is not divisible by }2)$

2. No primes less than $3\text{ divide into it. Therefore }3$ is prime:

$3=3$

3. Since $3\text{ is prime it has an exponent of }1:$

Answer: $3=3^1$
