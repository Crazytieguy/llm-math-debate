Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-72,23)$

\hrule

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-72,23)=\text{lcm}(72,23)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 72 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$72=2^3\times 3^2$

3. The prime factorization of 23 is:

$23=23^1$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }2\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }2^3 \\
\text{ The largest power of }3\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }3^2 \\
\text{ The largest power of 23 that appears in the prime factorizations is }23^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(72,23)=\left(2^3\times 3^2\times 23^1=1656\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-72,23)=1656$
