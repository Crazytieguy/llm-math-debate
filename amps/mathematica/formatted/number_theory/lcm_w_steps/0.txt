Find the least common multiple:

lcm$(-53,-39)$

\hrule

1. Any multiple of a negative number is also a multiple of its absolute value:

lcm$(-53,-39)=\text{lcm}(53,39)$

2. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the prime factorization of each integer}: \\
\text{ The prime factorization of 53 is}: \\
\end{array}$

$53=53^1$

3. The prime factorization of 39 is:

$39=3\times 13$

4. $\begin{array}{l}
\text{Find the largest power of each prime factor }\\
\text{ The largest power of }3\text{ that appears in the prime factorizations is }3^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 13 that appears in the prime factorizations is }13^1 \\
\text{ The largest power of 53 that appears in the prime factorizations is }53^1 \\
\text{ Therefore lcm}(53,39)=\left(3^1\times 13^1\times 53^1=2067\right): \\
\end{array}$

Answer: lcm$(-53,-39)=2067$
